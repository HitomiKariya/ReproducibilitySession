\maketitle 

\begin{abstract}
This is an example on how to make a reproducible paper. We are using R from Rstudio, creating an RSweave document. This is a nice start to create a nice paper and get an A+. The next sections will show the steps taken.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}  

This is my intro to my great paper, I will explain the cool things I can do with my new `computational thinking' powers combined with some Latex.

\section{Exploring Data}\label{explo}


Sections may use a label\footnote{In fact, you can have a label wherever you think a future reference to that content might be needed.}. This label is needed for referencing. For example the next section has label \emph{datas}, so you can reference it by writing: As we see in section \ref{catexplo}.

\subsection{Exploring Categorical Data}\label{catexplo}

You can see the statistics of categorical variables in Table \ref{catexplore_table}.

<<results=tex,echo=FALSE>>=

             cap = "Freq Table", 
             vertical = FALSE, 
             lab ="catexplore_table",
             caption.placement = "top",
             font.size = "normalsize")
@

You can see this variable plotted in Figure \ref{catexplore_plot}

          digits = 2,
          summary.stat = c("median","mean","min",'max','p25','p75','sd'))

In the Table \ref{numexplore_table}, you realize that the mean of FHF is {\bf\Sexpr{mean(dataidx$FHF,na.rm=T)}}.

<<num_table, echo=FALSE>>=
base=ggplot(data=dataidx)
box = base + geom_boxplot(aes(y=FHF,x=1)) 
box = box + geom_boxplot(aes(y=RWB,x=2))
box=box + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2),
                             labels = names(dataidx[,c(3,4)]))

\section{My Regression}\label{regre}

This is a Regression in R:

<<>>=
regre1=lm(FHF~RWB,data=dataidx)
@

This is another:

<<>>=
regre2=lm(FHF~RWB+ONIpolitical,data=dataidx)
@

\clearpage
These is a better summary, and for both:

<<echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
stargazer(regre1,regre2,title = "Regression Models",label = 'regs')
@

I hope you like what you see in the Table \ref{regs}.
